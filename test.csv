bacteria. However, when the pump is blocked, even much lower doses of the antibiotic are sufficient to kill the bacteria because the bacteria are unable to ‘pump out’ the antibiotic and
hence die. The MIC (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration) of the improved compositions is 8 fold lower in case of ciprofloxacin and 4 fold lower in case of norfloxacin."

Due to these isolation systems shift the fundamental time-period of the structure to a large value and dissipate the energy in damping, limiting the amount of force that can be transferred to the superstructure such that inter-story drift and floor accelerations are reduced drastically. In the range of 0.1 1.0 sec is the dominant time-period of typical earthquake accelerations and maximum acceleration usefully occurs in the range of 0.2  0.6 sec. Therefore, when the vibration time-period of the structure is increased beyond these limits the matching of fundamental frequencies of base-isolated structures and the predominant frequency contents of earthquake is avoided thereby the preventing the near-resonance response, resulting in dramatic reduction in structural response.

SEED OIL NANOEMULSION GEL FOR WOUND HEALING,Filed,"Tanurajvir Kaur, Deepak N Kapoor",FACULTY OF PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES,Drug Delivery,"Sea Buckthorn seed oil is reported to have significant wound healing
activity. Major drawback of treatment of wounds with conventional formulation or with pure Sea Buckthorn seed oil is lack of active molecule contact time with wound surface and its stability. Nanoemulsion gel formulation improved wound healing activity of SBT seed oil by improving its adhesion and permeability into the skin as compared to liquid oil or its conventional emulsified formulation. Liquid oil also presents with problem of topical application on wounds because of dripping, leaking, difficult dosing and poor absorption. Similar problems of dripping and leakage is also observed with nanoemulsions as such. These issues and problems are overcome by developing nanoemulsion gel system of Sea Buckthorn seed oil in the current invention."
